\zahvala{I would like to thank Berkant Barla Cambazoğlu for his valuable help, guidance, and patience during my research visit in Barcelona. The same applies for the incredibly talented team members of the Web Ranking team. Back at home, I thank my supervisor Jan Šnajder for his mentorship throughout my entire studies, and Domagoj Alagić for reading my thesis. Last, but not least, I am immensely grateful to my family, friends, my better half, and my dog for their unconditional love and support, forever and always.}
